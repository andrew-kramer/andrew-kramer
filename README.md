Hi, I'm @andrew-kramer, a full-stack web developer from Gainesville, Florida, United States.

Here you can find samples of code / applications that I've written at various times and choose to make available publicly. The idea is to show some examples of what I've done professionally. However, if any of the samples given are useful for some project of your own, please feel free to make use of it!

These samples are organized loosely by when they were written (most recent first). However, these samples are not projects that I am willing to make public in their entirety, so they *might* be incomplete or missing important parts. I'll try to discuss that within the individual sample projects themselves when that comes up.


Bon codage!

## Game Guides (2020-2021)

[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/andrew-kramer/django-guides-code-sample)

I'm not in my twenties anymore, so I don't have nearly as much time for gaming as I used to. When I do, though, I like to rescue all the puppies, fight all the baddies, and gather every single item, even if I already have six Wands of Destruction. I'm an organized guy, and sometimes it's weeks or months between play sessions. So the idea here was to make a simple checklist / guide for games that you could share with friends or publicly.

The frontend is a single-page Vue.js / Tailwind application, served (in test/production) as a static website. The local development environment uses [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/) to serve changes to the frontend in real-time to the browser.

On the backend, this project uses Python, Django, the [Django REST framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/), and [dj-rest-auth](https://pypi.org/project/dj-rest-auth/) to run a RESTful API.
