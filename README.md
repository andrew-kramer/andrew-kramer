Hi, I'm @andrew-kramer, an experienced DevOps engineer with a passion for building software solutions to solve real world problems. I pride myself in my ability to quickly learn new technologies and design solutions in unfamiliar areas, while still delivering quality results under tight deadlines.

My latest few projects have been heavily AWS-based, with Terraform for IaC and GitLab CI/CD pipelines.

I enjoy working in GovTech, because I enjoy providing services that help people and make a small difference in the world. I also enjoy working on resource-constrained projects, with a frequent need for modernizing systems and processes.

Some Technologies I'm comfortable with:
* Languages and Scripting
  * Python
  * Java
  * JavaScript
  * Golang
  * Bash
  * TypeScript
* Databases
  * PostgreSQL
  * MySQL
* Platforms
  * AWS
  * Linux
  * Docker
* Developer Tools
  * GitLab
  * Terraform
  * Jenkins
  * GitHub
